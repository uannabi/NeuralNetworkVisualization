# NeuralNetworkVisualization

Welcome to the Streamlit Neural Network Demonstrator repository! This project is all about implementing and visualizing basic neural networks using Streamlit, the Python framework that turns data scripts into shareable web apps with ease.

## About This Project

This repository showcases a basic implementation of neural networks in Python, made interactive and accessible through a Streamlit web application. It's designed for educational purposes, to help understand the workings of neural networks and to visualize their behavior.

## Features

- **Basic Neural Network Implementation:** Code and explanations of simple neural network architectures in Python.
- **Interactive Streamlit Web App:** A user-friendly interface to interact with and visualize the neural network's functioning.
- **Live Demonstrations:** See how changes in parameters affect the neural network in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- Basic understanding of neural networks and Python programming.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/uannabi/NeuralNetworkVisualization.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**

   ```
   cd NeuralNetworkVisualization****
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Using the App

- Launch the app and navigate through the interface.
- Adjust neural network parameters and observe the changes in real-time.
- Use the app to experiment with different neural network configurations.
